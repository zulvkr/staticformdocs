# FAQ

## Why you use Tailwind Forms and Typography plugins?

Well, styling a beautiful form and typography is rather effortful. So I shopped for libraries to make theming faster. We feel uncomfortable on using it though, we use `!important` to override some base value for basic theme form component. For now I will keep this setup.

## This documentation doesn't feel complete. Can you add [...] section?

I will update this docs regularly in the next few months. But if you are confused on something, you should lookup our source code, especially the notable configuration files and theme. Static Form is just implementation of Netlify CMS and Eleventy, so you can rely on their documentation for many things.

## Can I host it not in Netlify?

Yes, but you need to setup the OAuth authentication yourself. There are several [community maintained projects](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/external-oauth-clients/) you can use as a base.
