# FAQ

## Why you use Tailwind Forms and Typography plugins?

Well, styling form and text beautifully is rather painful and need to mind some edge cases. So we shopped for libraries to make theming faster. We feel uncomfortable on using it though, well, we used `!important` to override some base value for basic theme form component. We hate it too, BUT in the other side plugins makes theming much faster for common application. So we stick with these plugins for now.

## This documentation doesn't feel complete. Can you add [...] section?

We will update this docs regularly in the next few months. But if you are confused on some part, you should lookup our source code. Static Form is just implementation of Netlify CMS and Eleventy, so you can rely on their documentation for most part.

## Can I host it not in Netlify?

Yes, but you need to setup the OAuth authentication yourself. There are several [community maintained projects](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/external-oauth-clients/) you can use as a base.
